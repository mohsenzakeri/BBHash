# BBHash

This project implements a minimal perfect hash function using the BBHash method introduced in the paper "Fast and scalable minimal perfect hashing for massive key sets" (https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2017/7619/pdf/LIPIcs-SEA-2017-25.pdf). The xxhash library is used in this implementation: https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash
